# What is PolarDB-NodeAgent

***PolarDB-NodeAgent*** is a lightweight and flexible agent for data collection, which supports performance data collection from hosts and instances. It is a plug-in collection process running on physical machines or virtual machines, collecting performance data every second and real-time logs of all the instances (both containerized instances and non-containerized instances) on the machine.

PolarDB-NodeAgent has been tested in real projects on Alibaba Cloud.

Currently, open-source PolarDB-NodeAgent supports monitoring data collection of PolarDB for PostgreSQL.
